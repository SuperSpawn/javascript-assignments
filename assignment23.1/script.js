Question 1: 
    this will point to the window object, we are referencing this in the global scope

Question 2:
    this will point to the window object, we are referencing this in an arrow function which does not affect this even inside an object scope

Question 3: 
    this will point to nyFuncArrow because when calling a function except arrow functions, the this pointer will point to the current function

Question 4: 
    this will point to the window object, we are referencing this in an arrow function which does not affect this even inside an object scope

Question 5 a:
    this will point to the window object because it is referenced in an arrow function
Question 5 b:
    instead of using the arrow function, use a callback function instead
